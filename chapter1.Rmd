*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R Markdown syntax.*
I hope to learn how to use statistics in my research. I hope that during the course we will get clear explanations, as I am a very beginner. 
I found the course on weboodi.
